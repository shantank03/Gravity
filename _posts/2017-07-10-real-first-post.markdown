# An Introduction
Prior to this course, I had little to no experience with in-depth coding and interacting with a computer on a more technical level.
After 2 weeks, I've definitely gained a deeper understanding of these technical skilss that I thought I would never learn.
Being able to interact with servers using Linux and Unix has been challenging but very interesting at the same time.
