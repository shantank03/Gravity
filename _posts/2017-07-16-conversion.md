# Abstract
The work that I am converting is an essay I wrote for PLCY 340: Justic in Public Policy. In this course we examine the philosophy behind policy making.
My essay examines different approaches to measure a policy besides GDP. In this essay I look at different viewpoint like hedonism and preference selection.
I also make a case for GDP (as an economics major) and look at why GDP is not a good measure.

# Conversion Process
To convert my markdown document I used pandoc commands in Unix script that converted to a Microsoft Word document, text file, PDF, ODT, and HTML file.
Besides that, it didn't involve too much else.

# Links to the documents
You can view each of the documents, as long as the source file and the script, with these links to my GitHub repository page.
