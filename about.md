My name is Shantan Krovvidi and I am a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill.
I am a rising senior, double-majoring in Public Policy and Economics. 
I am applying for a minor in Information Science and I hope to one day work in the field of data science.

This website is about me, my hobbies and interests, and a myriad of other things which I hope you find interesting.

# Enjoy!
